# UFOs

## Overview

The goal of this analysis was to build a user interface for UFO sightings utlizing JavaScript and HTML. The webpage filters information about UFO sightings based on the date, city, country, and object shape allowing users to narrow their results when exploring the data. 

## Results

Users can select any combination of date, city, state, country, and/or shape to observe results in the table of sighting data.

## Summary

**Drawbacks**: While this exercise resulted in a user friendly webpage, the information available was limited. The data provided describes sightings from 2010, however, there are likely more sightings recorded outside of this year.

**Recommended Improvements**: Stemming off of the previously mentioned drawback, to improve this webpage, I recommend finding and scraping more data to incorporate into this webpage. Additionally, there are more ways we can improve the aesthetics of this webpage including items like more formatting, user-friendly features like a refresh button (added), and images would encourage more users to utilize the site.
